## [Unreleased]

### Added

- add Antigravity CLI (`agy`) provider — Google's terminal-native coding agent and the successor to the Gemini CLI after the free "Login with Google" path was retired (#323)

- add built-in Hermes provider support through profile-configured `hermesProfile` wrappers

## [2.2.0] - 2026-06-04

### Highlights

- **CAO memory** — Agents can now store and recall knowledge across sessions via `memory_store` / `memory_recall` / `memory_forget` MCP tools. Memories are scoped to `global` / `project` / `session` / `agent`, persisted as wiki-style markdown under `~/.aws/cli-agent-orchestrator/memory/`, indexed in SQLite with BM25 fallback retrieval, and auto-injected as `<cao-memory>` context at session start. Ships with CLI commands (`cao memory list/show/delete/clear`), tiered retention, file-lock concurrent-write safety, per-scope caps, and stable project identity via git remote. See [docs/memory.md](docs/memory.md). (#245, #254, #262)

- **External tool integration: OpenClaw & Hermes Agent** — A new external-tool-integration skill lets CAO orchestrate non-CAO CLI agents (OpenClaw, Hermes Agent, etc.) as first-class workers. Hermes Agent is shipped as a worked end-to-end example. See [docs/external-tool-integration.md](docs/external-tool-integration.md). (#241, #253)

### Added

- Build an MCP server for cao operations (#166)

- auto-delete handoff terminals with snapshot-based restore (#233)

- shell command tracking, flow recycling fixes, and inbox delivery reliability (#230)

- eager inbox delivery for providers that buffer input during processing (#251)

- forward `cao launch --env` vars to supervisor and child agents (#259)

- add optional `codexProfile` field to AgentProfile for codex provider (#250)

- add optional `permission_mode` field to AgentProfile for claude_code provider (#244)

- auto-derive CORS origins from `cao-server --host/--port` (#261)

- official devcontainer feature for CAO (#260)

- memory: Phase 2.5 hardening — per-scope caps, ISO-8601 Z round-trip lock, durability + concurrent flock tests, `memory.enabled` short-circuit, stable project identity via git remote (#262)

- enhance Web UI DashboardHome with filtering, sorting, grouping, and session deletion (#200)

- add OpenCode provider label to Web UI (#217)


### Documentation

- reorganize README, split detail into topic docs, and add control-plane overview (#225)

- fix Web UI build instructions and add 404 troubleshooting (#252)

- add install with pypi in README.md (#214)


### Fixed

- codex: detect v0.136+ TUI footer (`model · path` without `N% left`) so handoff/assign workers reliably reach COMPLETED instead of pinning at IDLE

- codex: skip `• Called <tool>(...)` MCP tool-call markers during last-message extraction so skill body text (including `[CAO Handoff]`) no longer leaks into worker output

- ci: stop TestPyPI squats breaking the release smoke test by installing the package with `--no-deps` and resolving deps from PyPI alone (#270)

- kiro_cli: treat MCP-server boot screen as PROCESSING and gate shell-baseline IDLE on `_initialized` to fix paste-into-boot-screen race that dropped the first message after launch (#268)

- mcp: reject `send_message` when `receiver_id` equals sender (#263)

- tmux name validation hardening (CodeQL #66) (#258)

- api: make network allowlists configurable via env vars (#255)

- tmux: filter environment to prevent 'command too long' errors (#246)

- session-service: resolve profile.provider in `create_session()` (#198)

- fix mcp worker provider resolution (#224)

- fix ops mcp profile provider resolution (#229)

- agent_profiles: guard agent-name path lookups against traversal (#228)

- install: harden agent-profile install against SSRF and path injection (#226)

- gemini_cli: isolate `GEMINI.md` per terminal in a dedicated workspace (#227)

- kiro_cli: fix handoff hang for Q Developer Pro — Credits marker not emitted in TUI mode (#238)

- kiro_cli: detect TUI `Initializing...` to prevent false IDLE (#215)

- tmux: start panes at 220x50 to avoid kiro-cli SIGWINCH input death (#218)

- launch: wait for idle before tmux attach on non-headless launch (#221)

- opencode: add a poller to OpenCode CLI inbox delivery to drain stuck messages (#210)
