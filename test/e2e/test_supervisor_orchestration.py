"""End-to-end supervisor orchestration tests for all providers.

Tests the REAL multi-agent flow where a supervisor agent uses MCP tools
(handoff, assign, send_message) to delegate work to sub-agents:

1. Launch supervisor with analysis_supervisor profile
2. Send a task requiring delegation
3. Verify supervisor calls handoff/assign (worker windows appear)
4. Verify supervisor produces a final combined response
5. Cleanup

This is distinct from test_handoff.py and test_assign.py which only test
individual worker agents receiving tasks directly via the API. Those tests
validate provider lifecycle (can receive input, produce output) but do NOT
test the MCP tool delegation flow.

Requires:
- Running CAO server
- Authenticated CLI tools
- Agent profiles installed: analysis_supervisor, data_analyst, report_generator
  (install with: cao install examples/assign/analysis_supervisor.md)

    uv run pytest -m e2e test/e2e/test_supervisor_orchestration.py -v -o "addopts="

    Some providers report COMPLETED after initial text output but before MCP
    tool calls (handoff/assign) finish creating worker terminals. A provider
    whose TUI keeps the idle prompt visible at all times can make the status
    detector see "response + idle prompt" = COMPLETED even while the model is
    between text output and the first MCP tool call.

    Similarly, Codex can briefly show COMPLETED between consecutive MCP tool
    calls (e.g., after assign returns but before handoff starts). Requiring
    ``stable_count`` consecutive COMPLETED readings avoids these false positives.

    The ``handoff`` MCP tool auto-deletes its worker terminal as soon as the
    worker finishes. A point-in-time session listing taken after the
    supervisor reports COMPLETED can therefore miss workers that came and
    went during the run. To avoid this race we accumulate the union of every
    unique terminal id observed across all polls — once seen, a worker
    "counts" even if it has since been cleaned up.
