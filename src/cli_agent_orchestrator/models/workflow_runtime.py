"""Lightweight workflow runtime DTOs (issue #312, Bolt 2).

These are the transient, runtime-facing value objects of the workflow feature:
the derived index row, the structured step-output record, and the MCP return
envelope — plus the per-step ``StepState`` enum they share.

They live in a SEPARATE module from ``models/workflow.py`` ON PURPOSE: the spec
grammar in ``workflow.py`` imports ``jsonschema`` and ``yaml`` at module scope,
and the MCP server (``mcp_server/server.py``) must stay lightweight on the single
HTTP seam — it consumes ``ReturnAck`` but has no business pulling a JSON-schema
validator + YAML parser into its process just to name a Pydantic envelope. This
module imports neither. ``models/workflow.py`` re-exports every name here, so
existing ``from ...models.workflow import StepState`` call sites are unaffected.
