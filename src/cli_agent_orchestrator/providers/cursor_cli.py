"""Cursor CLI provider implementation.

This module provides the CursorCliProvider class for integrating with the
Cursor CLI (https://cursor.com/cli), Anysphere's terminal-native AI coding
assistant. The CLI is invoked via the ``cursor-agent`` binary (preferred;
unambiguous name shared only with the Cursor CLI) and falls back to the
primary ``agent`` name (Cursor's documented top-level command per
https://cursor.com/docs/cli/overview) when the legacy alias is missing.
When the primary ``agent`` name is selected the provider runs a
``agent --version`` probe to confirm the resolved binary is the Cursor
CLI (a number of unrelated tools also install an ``agent`` binary).

Cursor CLI v2026.06.15 (the version ``curl https://cursor.com/install | bash``
ships today) has dropped or moved several flags the provider previously
relied on. The v2026 launch command the provider builds:

- ``--force`` auto-approves tool calls so the agent does not block on
  per-tool approval prompts during orchestration.
- ``--model`` selects a specific model (e.g. ``gpt-5``, ``sonnet-4``,
  ``composer-2.5``).
- ``--plugin-dir <path>`` injects MCP server configuration. v2026
  removed the ``--mcp <json>`` flag in favour of ``--plugin-dir``
  pointing at a directory holding Cursor plugin manifests. The
  provider synthesises that directory from the agent profile's
  ``mcpServers`` map at launch time.
- ``--approve-mcps`` pre-approves MCP servers declared via
  ``--plugin-dir`` so the REPL does not block on a per-server
  approval dialog.

Flags deliberately omitted for v2026.06.15:

- ``--system-prompt <file>`` is omitted because v2026.06.15's backend
  rejects every request that carries a ``--system-prompt <file>``
  payload with ``[invalid_argument] unknown option '--system-prompt'``
  regardless of the file's contents (a 3-character file reproduces
  the bug). Multi-turn inbox still works because the CAO role context
  reaches the agent via the ``cao-mcp-server`` MCP tool's handoff /
  assign payloads. The preserved ``_write_system_prompt_file`` helper
  is ready to re-enable this path when Cursor ships a fixed client.
- ``--agent <name>`` is omitted because v2026 removed the flag
  (issue #300).
- ``--trust`` is omitted because v2026 rejects it in interactive
  REPL mode ("only works with --print/headless mode").
- ``--mcp <json>`` is replaced by ``--plugin-dir`` as noted above.

Skill catalog injection: the provider forwards the skill catalog via
the shared ``_apply_skill_prompt`` helper from :class:`BaseProvider`
to the (currently disabled) system prompt path. When ``--system-prompt``
is re-enabled, the catalog will be appended at launch.

Status detection is pattern-based. v2026+ uses a full Ink/TUI; the
provider detects the "ctrl+c to stop" hint Cursor renders on the
input-box line every frame the agent is working on a turn. Older
text-mode builds are still classified by the legacy ``❯`` prompt
and ``─────`` separator regex suite (mirrors the Claude Code
provider's structural fix for the stale-spinner bug).

Status detection is pattern-based. Cursor CLI uses an Ink-style interactive
prompt (``❯``) for IDLE / COMPLETED, spinner text with ellipsis for
PROCESSING, and a structural "thinking-before-separator" check borrowed
from the Claude Code provider to avoid stale-spinner false positives.

# ANSI escape code pattern for stripping terminal colors.
ANSI_CODE_PATTERN = r"\x1b\[[0-9;]*m"

# Cursor CLI uses the same spinner glyph vocabulary as Claude Code while
# generating a response. Match a spinner char + text + ellipsis on a single
# line. Examples: "⠋ Thinking…", "✶ Reasoning… (esc to interrupt)".
PROCESSING_PATTERN = r"[⠋⠙⠹⠸⠼⠴⠦⠧⠇⠏✶✢✽✻✳·][^\n]*\u2026"

# Cursor CLI's REPL prompt is a "❯" character (right arrow) with optional
# space / non-breaking space, identical in shape to Claude Code's prompt.
# The pattern is anchored to the start of a line (with optional SGR colour
# codes before the prompt) so it does NOT match the leading "❯ " on echoed
# user input lines (e.g. "❯ Summarize…") or any "> " inside response
# content. This matches the claude_code provider's _SOL_IDLE_RE pattern.
IDLE_PROMPT_PATTERN = r"^\s*(?:\x1b\[[0-9;]*m)*[❯>](?:\x1b\[[0-9;]*m)*[\s\xa0]"

# Same pattern for log files (no ANSI involved). Still start-of-line
# anchored so the log pre-check is consistent with live status detection.
IDLE_PROMPT_PATTERN_LOG = r"^\s*[❯>][\s\xa0]"

# Footer shown while a TUI selection widget is active (mode picker, model
# picker, file completion overlay).
WAITING_USER_ANSWER_PATTERN = r"↑/↓ to navigate"

# v2026+ TUI processing indicator. When the agent is actively working
# on a turn, Cursor renders the input-box line with the placeholder
# text followed by "ctrl+c to stop" on the same line — this is the
# "you can interrupt me with Ctrl+C" hint. The indicator is absent
# on every other state (idle, completed, freshly launched, brand-new
# TUI). The placeholder itself ("Add a follow-up" / "Plan, search,
# build anything") is ALWAYS present in v2026 regardless of state,
# so it cannot distinguish idle from processing on its own — the
# presence / absence of "ctrl+c to stop" is the reliable signal.
TUI_PROCESSING_INDICATOR_PATTERN = r"ctrl\+c to stop"

# Workspace trust dialog (Cursor asks once per directory the first time the
# agent is launched there).
TRUST_PROMPT_PATTERN = r"do you trust (?:the )?files? in this folder|confirm folder trust"

# Permission / approval dialog that appears when the agent wants to run a
# shell command or edit a file without ``--force`` enabled.
PERMISSION_PROMPT_PATTERN = (
    r"(?:do you want to (?:allow|run)|approve this action|\[\s*y\s*/\s*n\s*\])"

# Separator regex. Matches a contiguous run of at least 20 box-drawing
# horizontal characters (U+2500), with an optional CSI escape between any
# two consecutive dashes. This is the correct "CSI interleaved with the
# separator" pattern: Cursor's TUI re-renders the separator in place
# with new colour escapes on every prompt, so the byte stream looks
# like:
#   ─\x1b[0m──\x1b[38;5;245m──\x1b[0m──…
# The pattern is anchored to a full line (``^…$``) so we don't match
# a stray dash sequence inside response content.
# Intermediate bytes are restricted to the ECMA-48 param range
# (0x30-0x3F) so a stray ``ESC [`` introducer is not consumed.

)

# Cursor CLI v2026+ runs a full Ink/TUI in interactive mode. The text-mode
# `❯` prompt and the `─────` separator are no longer emitted as text in
# the pipe-pane buffer — they are rendered as TUI widgets. The only
# stable, plain-text signal the TUI emits into the scrollback is the
# input-box placeholder plus the status bar ("Composer 2.5 Fast" /
# "Run Everything"). Cursor REPLACES the placeholder with the user's
# text on submit and only redraws it once the agent has finished a
# turn, so the presence/absence of this placeholder is a reliable
# idle/processing signal even though the placeholder itself is no
# longer "an idle prompt" in the text-mode sense.
#
# The exact placeholder text varies by conversation state:
#
#   * fresh launch, no prior turns:    ``Plan, search, build anything``
#   * after the first user turn:       ``Add a follow-up``
#
# Both are emitted as a single string in the input-box line; either
# indicates the input box is empty and the agent is ready for the
# next turn. We match either of them. The pattern is intentionally
# case-insensitive: a few builds render "plan" lower-case depending
# on the locale.

        ``cursor-agent`` binary resolves to the same REPL; we prefer
        the primary name so newly-installed machines work out of the
        box.

        Flags used (v2026.06.15):
        - ``--force`` auto-approves tool calls so the agent does not
          block on per-tool approval prompts during orchestration.
        - ``--model`` selects a specific model (when configured).
        - ``--system-prompt <path>`` is **deliberately omitted** —
          v2026.06.15 has a confirmed bug where any request that
          carries a ``--system-prompt <file>`` payload is rejected
          by the backend with ``[invalid_argument] unknown option
          '--system-prompt'`` regardless of file contents. The
          CAO role context still reaches the agent via the
          ``cao-mcp-server`` MCP tool's handoff / assign payloads.
        - ``--plugin-dir`` injects MCP server configuration. v2026
          removed the ``--mcp <json>`` flag in favour of
          ``--plugin-dir <path>`` pointing at a directory that holds
          Cursor plugin / MCP server manifests. We synthesise the
          directory from the agent profile's ``mcpServers`` map at
          launch time and keep it under the CAO tmp dir.
        - ``--approve-mcps`` pre-approves MCP servers declared via
          ``--plugin-dir`` so the REPL does not block on a per-server
          approval dialog.

        The CAO agent profile is no longer passed as ``--agent <name>``
        — that flag was removed in v2026. The profile's identity is
        preserved via the system-prompt content (the profile markdown
        body) and the synthesised plugin-dir layout. Multi-agent
        orchestration (handoff / assign) continues to work because the
        inbox / MCP tools are the same across all profiles.
