"""Constants for CLI Agent Orchestrator (CAO) application.

This module defines all configuration constants used throughout the CAO application,
including directory paths, server settings, and provider configurations.

The CAO application orchestrates multiple CLI-based AI agents (Kiro CLI, Claude Code,
Codex, Kimi CLI, Q CLI) through tmux sessions, providing a unified interface
for agent management.

# byte-stable (quiescence debounce). Empirically, rendering without the

# debounce is what collapses status flaps to ~0. Default ON: validated live on
# real Claude + Kimi turns (init, multi-turn, send_message, handoff) and by the
# full e2e gauntlet in pyte mode (allowed-tools, assign, cross-provider,
# handoff, send_message, skills, supervisor orchestration — every test green;
# the only failures traced to network outages and a slow uvx MCP launch path,
# not detection). Only providers that opt in via supports_screen_detection

# terminal produces no new output, so no IDLE/COMPLETED status event fires to
# wake delivery. Those messages would otherwise stay PENDING forever. A slow,
# provider-agnostic background sweep re-attempts delivery for any message left
# pending past the grace window below, a catch-all fallback under the fast paths
# and the OpenCode poller (issue #131).
