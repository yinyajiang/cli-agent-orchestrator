"""In-process, bounded, time-windowed fleet event ring buffer.

This is the single source of truth for *historical replay* of CAO fleet events
in the MCP App. CAO's existing ``event_bus.py`` is live pub/sub only (no replay);
the SQLite store holds durable domain state, not a semantic event timeline. The
``EventLog`` fills that gap: a thread-safe ``deque`` capped at 500 events with a
24-hour TTL, expressing every row in the six-primitive vocabulary so the iframe
can re-hydrate its governance ticker after any re-mount.

Privacy boundary: the ``detail`` field stores **metadata only** — message bodies
are never persisted here. Callers (notably ``EventLogPublisher``) are responsible
for passing only metadata; this module never inspects or strips bodies, it simply
stores what it is given verbatim, so the contract is "give me metadata only".
