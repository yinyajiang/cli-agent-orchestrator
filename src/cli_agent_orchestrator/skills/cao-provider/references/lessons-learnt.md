# Lessons Learnt from Provider Development

Hard-won lessons from building and maintaining 7 CAO providers. Read this before implementing a new provider.

**Essential reading:** Review `docs/tool-restrictions.md` for the full tool restriction architecture (two-layer system, resolution hierarchy, per-provider enforcement, cross-provider inheritance, known limitations). That doc is the source of truth for how role, allowedTools, and enforcement work end-to-end.

## 1. Stale Buffer Matching (Critical)

**Problem:** Matching processing patterns (spinner characters like `✽ Cooking…`) against the full tmux history buffer. Old spinner lines persist in the buffer even after the agent finishes. Since PROCESSING is typically checked before COMPLETED in `get_status()`, the terminal gets stuck returning PROCESSING forever.

**Fix:** Either:
- Check COMPLETED before PROCESSING — if both the idle prompt and response marker are present at the bottom of the buffer, the agent is done regardless of historical spinners
- Only match processing patterns against the last N lines (use `tail_lines` parameter)
- Use a latching mechanism: once you detect a response marker, don't go back to PROCESSING

**Example:** Claude Code's `PROCESSING_PATTERN = r"[✶✢✽✻✳].*…"` matched against the full 200-line buffer caused a flaky e2e test (`test_reviewer_cannot_write`) to timeout at 180s.

## 2. Double Enter After Paste

**Problem:** After tmux bracketed paste (`paste-buffer -p`), some TUIs enter multi-line mode. The first Enter adds a newline; the second Enter on the empty line triggers submission.

**Fix:** Override the `paste_enter_count` property in your provider:
```python
@property
def paste_enter_count(self) -> int:
    return 2  # Default. Override to 1 if single Enter submits.
```

## 3. New TUI Format Breaking Detection

**Problem:** CLI tools frequently update their TUI. Kiro CLI changed from `[agent] >` to `agent · model · ◔ N%` with `ask a question, or describe a task` as the idle indicator. The old regex stopped matching.

**Fix:** 
- Build detection for multiple prompt formats (old and new)
- Use fallback patterns: check the primary pattern first, then fall back to alternatives
- Consider adding a `--legacy-ui` flag if the CLI supports it
- Example from Kiro CLI:
```python
has_idle_prompt = re.search(self._idle_prompt_pattern, clean_output)
has_new_tui_idle = re.search(NEW_TUI_IDLE_PATTERN, clean_output)
if not has_idle_prompt and not has_new_tui_idle:
    return TerminalStatus.PROCESSING
```

## 4. Exception Wrapping in load_agent_profile()

**Problem:** `load_agent_profile()` was wrapping `FileNotFoundError` as `RuntimeError`. Callers like `resolve_provider()` only caught `FileNotFoundError`, so JSON-only agent profiles (AIM-installed) caused assign() to fail.

**Fix:** Re-raise `FileNotFoundError` directly, don't wrap it:
```python
except FileNotFoundError:
    raise  # Let callers handle this specifically
except Exception as e:
    raise RuntimeError(f"Failed to load profile: {e}")
```

## 5. ANSI Codes Everywhere

**Problem:** Terminal output is full of ANSI escape sequences (colors, cursor movement, formatting). Pattern matching fails if you don't strip them first.

**Fix:** Always strip ANSI codes before any pattern matching:
```python
ANSI_CODE_PATTERN = r"\x1b\[[0-9;]*m"
clean_output = re.sub(ANSI_CODE_PATTERN, "", output)
```

## 6. TOOL_MAPPING Is Only for Translation

**Problem:** Adding a `TOOL_MAPPING` entry for providers that accept CAO vocabulary directly (like Kiro CLI). This is unnecessary and was causing the launch prompt to show misleading `Blocked: (none)`.

**Fix:** Only add `TOOL_MAPPING` entries for providers whose native tool names differ from CAO's vocabulary:
- **Need TOOL_MAPPING:** Claude Code (`execute_bash` → `Bash`), Copilot CLI (`execute_bash` → `shell`)
- **Don't need TOOL_MAPPING:** Kiro CLI (accepts `allowedTools` in agent JSON), Kimi CLI, Codex (system prompt enforcement)

## 7. Confirmation Prompt Blocks Automation

**Problem:** The `cao launch` confirmation prompt (`Proceed? [Y/n]`) blocks automated flows, scripts, and agent-to-agent launches. `--yolo` skips it but also removes all restrictions.

**Fix:** `--auto-approve` flag skips the prompt while keeping restrictions enforced. When building a new provider, ensure your e2e tests work with the existing launch flow (they go through the API, not CLI, so this shouldn't affect them — but be aware of it).

## 8. tmux Session Cleanup in Tests

**Problem:** E2e tests that create multiple terminals (send_message needs 2, supervisor tests need 2-3) can leave stale tmux sessions. Subsequent tests may find terminals in `error` state.

**Fix:** Always clean up in a `finally` block. If tests are flaky with `status: error`, it's likely leftover sessions from previous test runs.

## 9. Provider-Specific MCP Configuration

**Problem:** Claude Code doesn't automatically forward parent shell environment variables to MCP subprocesses.

**Fix:** When building the MCP config, explicitly inject `CAO_TERMINAL_ID` into the env:
```python
env = mcp_config[server_name].get("env", {})
if "CAO_TERMINAL_ID" not in env:
    env["CAO_TERMINAL_ID"] = self.terminal_id
    mcp_config[server_name]["env"] = env
```

## 10. Nested Session Detection

**Problem:** When cao-server runs inside a Claude Code session, `CLAUDE*` env vars leak into spawned tmux panes. Claude Code detects these and refuses to start ("nested session").

**Fix:** Unset `CLAUDE*` env vars before launching (except auth-related ones like `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK`):
```python
unset_cmd = (
    "unset $(env | sed -n 's/^\\(CLAUDE[A-Z_]*\\)=.*/\\1/p'"
    " | grep -v -E 'CLAUDE_CODE_USE_(BEDROCK|VERTEX|FOUNDRY)'"
    ") 2>/dev/null"
)
```

## 11. Role → allowedTools Resolution Chain

**Problem:** New providers skip tool restriction wiring because the resolution path is non-obvious. The `role` field in agent profiles is not just a label — it drives the default `allowedTools` bundle, which in turn determines what native tools get blocked.

**Resolution chain:**
1. Explicit `allowedTools` in profile or `--allowed-tools` CLI flag (highest priority)
2. Role-based defaults from `constants.py` (`supervisor` → `["@cao-mcp-server", "fs_read", "fs_list"]`, `developer` → `["@builtin", "fs_*", "execute_bash", "@cao-mcp-server"]`, `reviewer` → `["@builtin", "fs_read", "fs_list", "@cao-mcp-server"]`)
3. Custom roles from `settings.json` (user-defined bundles)
4. Fallback: unrestricted `["*"]` (backward compatible)
5. MCP server names appended as `@server_name`

**Fix:** When building your provider's `_build_command()`, always check `self._allowed_tools` and apply restrictions. The resolution is already done by the time your provider receives the list — you just need to enforce it via CLI flags, agent JSON, or system prompt.

## 12. Child allowedTools=["*"] Must Override Parent Restrictions

**Problem:** When a supervisor (restricted to `@cao-mcp-server,fs_read,fs_list`) assigns work to a developer (unrestricted `["*"]`), the developer was inheriting the supervisor's restrictions. This happened because `_resolve_child_allowed_tools()` treated `["*"]` the same as `None` (no opinion).

**Fix:** Explicit `["*"]` means "I am unrestricted" and must NOT be overridden by parent restrictions. The resolution logic in `mcp_server/server.py` is:
- Parent unrestricted or None → use child's tools
- Child is None (no opinion) → inherit parent's restrictions
- Child is `["*"]` (explicit unrestricted) → honor it, return None (unrestricted)
- Both have explicit lists → child gets its own tools

When writing handoff/assign logic, never flatten `["*"]` to `None` before passing to `_resolve_child_allowed_tools()`.

## 13. Three Enforcement Approaches — Know Which One Your Provider Needs

**Problem:** Implementing tool restrictions the wrong way for your provider type. A provider that accepts CAO vocabulary in agent JSON doesn't need TOOL_MAPPING, and a provider with no native restriction mechanism can only use soft enforcement (system prompt).

**The three approaches:**
- **Hard via CLI flags** (Claude Code `--disallowedTools`, Copilot CLI `--deny-tool`): Add provider to `TOOL_MAPPING` in `tool_mapping.py` to translate CAO vocabulary → native tool names. `get_disallowed_tools()` computes which native tools to block.
- **Hard via agent JSON** (Kiro CLI): The CLI reads `allowedTools` from the agent profile at install time. No `TOOL_MAPPING` entry needed — pass CAO vocabulary directly.
- **Soft via system prompt** (Kimi CLI, Codex): No native restriction mechanism. CAO prepends `SECURITY_PROMPT` from `constants.py` to the system prompt. This is advisory only — the CLI can still use any tool.

**Limitation:** Soft enforcement is not a security boundary. If a provider doesn't support native tool blocking, document this in the provider's docs under "Known Limitations".

## 14. Shell Warm-up Before CLI Launch

**Problem:** `wait_for_shell()` detects a stable shell prompt, but shell initialization scripts (.zshrc, brew shellenv, nvm) may still be running in the background. Launching a CLI immediately causes it to silently exit or hang (e.g., a TUI CLI exits without error).

**Fix:** After `wait_for_shell()`, send an echo round-trip with a unique marker to verify the shell is fully initialized:
```python
marker = f"CAO_SHELL_READY_{self.terminal_id}"
tmux_client.send_keys(session, window, f"echo {marker}")
# Poll until marker appears in output
```
This adds ~2 seconds but prevents silent launch failures.

## 15. TERM Environment Variable Compatibility

**Problem:** Some CLIs (e.g., Kimi CLI v1.20.0+) silently exit when `TERM=tmux-256color` (the tmux default). No error message, just immediate exit — leaving the terminal stuck in PROCESSING forever.

**Fix:** If your CLI fails silently inside tmux, try overriding the TERM variable:
```python
command = f"TERM=xterm-256color {base_command}"
```
Test your provider both inside and outside tmux to catch this.

## 16. Alt-Screen vs Scrollback — A Fundamental Design Decision

**Problem:** CLIs operate in one of two modes: alt-screen (full-screen TUI, e.g., Kimi) or scrollback (output in normal terminal buffer, e.g., Codex with `--no-alt-screen`). Detection logic differs significantly between the two.

**Key differences:**
- **Alt-screen:** Idle prompt is at a fixed position near the bottom. Use `tail_lines` to check bottom N lines (typically 50). Pattern matching anchors to bottom-of-screen, not end-of-output.
- **Scrollback:** Full history persists across interactions. Previous idle prompts remain in buffer. Must use recency heuristics (e.g., last 5 lines only for idle check) or latching flags to distinguish current state from history.

**Fix:** Decide which mode your CLI uses early. If scrollback, you'll need more defensive pattern matching and likely a `TAIL_LINES` constant calibrated to your TUI's output density.

## 17. Startup Prompt Stabilization Loop

**Problem:** Many CLIs show cascading prompts on first launch: workspace trust → permission bypass → terms acceptance → model selection. A single-check approach misses subsequent prompts.

**Fix:** Handle startup prompts in a polling loop, not one-shot:
```python
def _handle_startup_prompts(self, timeout: float = 20.0):
    deadline = time.time() + timeout
    while time.time() < deadline:
        output = tmux_client.get_history(...)
        if self._detect_trust_prompt(output):
            self._dismiss_trust_prompt()
        elif self._detect_bypass_prompt(output):
            self._dismiss_bypass_prompt()
        elif self._detect_idle_prompt(output):
            return  # All prompts cleared
        time.sleep(0.5)
```
Test with a fresh install (no cached settings) to catch all prompts.

## 18. Stale Permission Prompt Detection

**Problem:** Permission prompts like `Allow this action? [y/n/t]:` stay in the buffer after the user answers. If `get_status()` sees the prompt text, it returns WAITING_USER_ANSWER even though the agent already continued.

**Fix:** Count idle prompt lines AFTER the last permission prompt. Active prompt: 0–1 idle lines after it. Stale prompt: 2+ idle lines (user answered, agent continued):
```python
last_perm_idx = max(i for i, line in enumerate(lines) if re.search(PERM_PATTERN, line))
idle_lines_after = sum(1 for line in lines[last_perm_idx:] if re.search(IDLE_PATTERN, line))
if idle_lines_after >= 2:
    # Stale — don't return WAITING_USER_ANSWER
```

## 19. Per-Directory Single-Instance Locks

**Problem:** Some CLIs (e.g., Kimi CLI v1.20.0+) enforce one process per working directory. Parallel operations (3x data analyst via assign) fail when instances try to share a directory.

**Fix:** Create a unique temp directory per provider instance:
```python
import tempfile
self._work_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp(prefix=f"cao_{provider_name}_")
command = f"cd {self._work_dir} && {base_command}"
```
Clean up the temp directory in `cleanup()`.

## 20. E2E Validation: All 11 Tests Must Pass (Minimum Success Criteria)

**Problem:** Unit tests and basic e2e tests pass, but the provider fails in real orchestration scenarios. Common failure modes: supervisor doesn't receive worker callbacks so it does the work itself, handoff times out so the supervisor falls back to doing everything inline, or tool restrictions aren't enforced so the reviewer writes files it shouldn't. These failures are only caught by the full e2e suite — passing all 11 tests is the **minimum success criteria** before declaring a provider ready.

**The 11 core e2e tests per provider:**

### Handoff tests (2 tests) — `test/e2e/test_handoff.py`

| Test | What it validates | Why it matters |
|------|-------------------|----------------|
| `test_handoff_simple_function` | Create terminal → send task ("write a Python greet function") → wait for COMPLETED → extract output containing the function | Validates the full lifecycle: initialization, idle detection, message sending, processing detection, completion detection, and message extraction. If this fails, nothing else will work. |
| `test_handoff_second_task` | Send a second independent task to the same terminal → verify it produces correct output with no state leakage from the first task | Validates that the provider correctly resets between tasks. If COMPLETED detection is latching or stale buffer matching isn't handled, the second task will return the first task's output. |

### Assign tests (3 tests) — `test/e2e/test_assign.py`

| Test | What it validates | Why it matters |
|------|-------------------|----------------|
| `test_assign_data_analyst` | Worker terminal with `data_analyst` profile analyzes dataset [1,2,3,4,5] and produces statistical output (mean, median, stdev) | Validates that agent profiles with system prompts load correctly and the provider can handle domain-specific tasks. If `load_agent_profile()` fails or system prompt injection is broken, the worker produces generic output instead of statistical analysis. |
| `test_assign_report_generator` | Worker terminal with `report_generator` profile creates a structured report template with sections (Executive Summary, Analysis, Conclusions) | Validates that a different agent profile produces structurally different output. Catches cases where profiles are silently ignored or swapped. |
| `test_assign_with_callback` | Full round-trip: create supervisor terminal → create worker terminal → worker completes task → worker calls `send_message()` back to supervisor → verify supervisor inbox receives the result | **The most critical assign test.** Validates the complete assign flow including MCP tool usage (`send_message`), inbox delivery, and cross-terminal communication. If this fails, the supervisor never receives worker results and falls back to doing everything itself. |

### Send Message test (1 test) — `test/e2e/test_send_message.py`

| Test | What it validates | Why it matters |
|------|-------------------|----------------|
| `test_send_message_to_inbox` | Create two terminals → send a message from terminal A to terminal B's inbox → verify terminal B receives and processes the message | Validates inbox delivery mechanics: message queuing, idle detection (messages only deliver when receiver is IDLE), and the provider's ability to process injected messages. If idle detection is broken, messages queue forever and are never delivered. |

### Allowed Tools tests (3 tests) — `test/e2e/test_allowed_tools.py`

| Test | What it validates | Why it matters |
|------|-------------------|----------------|
| `test_restricted_supervisor_cannot_bash` | Supervisor role (restricted to `@cao-mcp-server, fs_read, fs_list`) attempts to run a bash command → verify it's blocked | Validates that tool restrictions are actually enforced by the provider's native mechanism (CLI flags, agent JSON, policy engine, or system prompt). If the provider silently ignores `allowed_tools`, supervisors can execute arbitrary code — a security boundary violation. Marked `xfail` for soft-enforcement providers (Codex, Kimi). |
| `test_unrestricted_developer_can_bash` | Developer role (unrestricted `["*"]`) runs a bash command → verify it succeeds | Validates that unrestricted access works and the provider doesn't over-restrict. Catches cases where the restriction logic has an off-by-one or blocks everything. |
| `test_allowed_tools_stored_in_metadata` | Launch with explicit `allowed_tools` → verify they're persisted in DB and returned by `GET /terminals/{id}` | Validates the full pipeline from CLI flag → API → DB → response. If metadata isn't stored, the web UI can't display restrictions and debugging becomes impossible. |

### Supervisor Orchestration tests (2 tests) — `test/e2e/test_supervisor_orchestration.py`

| Test | What it validates | Why it matters |
|------|-------------------|----------------|
| `test_supervisor_handoff` | Supervisor terminal uses the `handoff()` MCP tool to delegate a task to a `report_generator` worker → verify the supervisor receives the worker's output and incorporates it into its final response | **Tests the supervisor's ability to use MCP tools.** Unlike `test_handoff_simple_function` (which sends tasks via API), this test verifies the supervisor agent autonomously calls the handoff MCP tool. If MCP config injection (`CAO_TERMINAL_ID`) is broken, the supervisor can't find the MCP server and falls back to answering directly — producing a plausible but wrong response. |
| `test_supervisor_assign_and_handoff` | Supervisor uses both `assign()` and `handoff()` MCP tools in a single workflow — assigns worker(s) and hands off to another → verify the supervisor produces a final output that incorporates delegated results | **The ultimate integration test.** Exercises assign (non-blocking) + handoff (blocking) + status detection under concurrent load. If the supervisor fails to receive assign callbacks (broken `send_message` delivery), it will do the analysis work itself instead of waiting for workers. The test catches this by checking that the output references delegated results rather than self-generated analysis. |

### Running the full suite

```bash
# All 11 tests for your provider (replace NewCli with your test class prefix)
uv run pytest test/e2e/ -v -k "NewCli" -o "addopts="

# Or run by category
uv run pytest test/e2e/test_handoff.py -v -k "NewCli" -o "addopts="
uv run pytest test/e2e/test_assign.py -v -k "NewCli" -o "addopts="
uv run pytest test/e2e/test_send_message.py -v -k "NewCli" -o "addopts="
uv run pytest test/e2e/test_allowed_tools.py -v -k "NewCli" -o "addopts="
uv run pytest test/e2e/test_supervisor_orchestration.py -v -k "NewCli" -o "addopts="
```

**All 11 tests must pass.** A provider that fails even one test has a gap that will surface in production — either as a supervisor doing workers' jobs, messages never delivering, tool restrictions not enforced, or handoffs silently timing out. The manual `examples/assign/` flow (supervisor → 3x data analyst + 1x report generator) is a good smoke test, but it does not replace the automated suite:

```bash
cao install examples/assign/data_analyst.md
cao install examples/assign/report_generator.md
cao install examples/assign/analysis_supervisor.md
cao launch --agents analysis_supervisor --provider new_cli --auto-approve
```
Use `--provider` to target your new provider (otherwise it defaults to `kiro_cli`). Use `--auto-approve` to skip the confirmation prompt while keeping tool restrictions enforced, or `--yolo` for unrestricted access during initial debugging.
